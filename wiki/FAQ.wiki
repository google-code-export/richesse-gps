 # How to make RichesseGPS work on HTC Touch HD?

   * *Start | Settings*, select *System* tab, tap on *External GPS*
   * On *program* tab, select *COM6* for GPS program port
   * On *Hardware* tab, leave the option *GPS hardware port* blank (i.e. *(none)*)
   * On *Access* tab, check *Manage GPS automatically*
 
   * In RichcesseGPS, go *Menu | Options*, select *GPS* tab
   * Set the GPS port to *COM6*

   * Try to tap on *GPS On*, on the main window. It can take a while till you see something.

 These are working options on my device, but rememeber that YMMV...
